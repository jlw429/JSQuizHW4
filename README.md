# Multiple Choice 5 question quiz

04 Web API COde quiz using JS.
Rules- Create a multiple choice quiz using questions involving JS. If the answer is incorrect, you subtract from the timer.

I used five questions, and gave it 80 seconds. If you got it wrong, you lost 20 seconds.

## My thoughts

This was a hard one. I have never been more frustrated than I was with this one. NO doubt about it. I had to use all my life lines to help clean up the bugs. The main bug is still there, kinda, I just made a work-around. It involved the array of questions doubling points after question 3, as well as splicing doubly the available questions. I learned about the "remove event listener", I just that to work, and it got the job done. I still dont know nor anyone can figure out what I did wrong to put the work around in there.

The timer works correctly and reduces time if it is incorrect as well as local storage by sending the score to the next page. Overall, I have alot to learn and my ability to "think like a programmer still has a ways to go.
